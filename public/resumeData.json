    "bio":"Hi! I am a full stack web developer with a background in finance and e-commerce. I started off my career as a Trade Controll Analyst for CIBC, and completed the CFA exam. Along the way, I established my own company: Ikigai & Soul, that is where I discovered my passion for technology and programming. As the founder of a mid-sized e-commerce company, I am passionate about creating seamless user interfaces that can generate maximum results. That passion along with my 3 years of experience in the financial industry, has given me the skills to bridge the gap between business and technology.",
